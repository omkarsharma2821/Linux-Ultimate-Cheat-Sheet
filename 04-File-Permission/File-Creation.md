# Which Linux Command Creates Files Best?

## 1. Using `cat` Command

The `cat` command can be used to create and view files, but **cannot be used to edit existing content**.

### Create a File
```
cat > file1
```
- (>) redirects output into the file.
- Use Ctrl + D to save and exit.

## Append to a File
```
cat >> file1
```
- (>>) appends new data to the file without modifying existing content.
- Note: `cat` is not a text editor.
- `cat` >> file1 { >> use to add new data without changing existing data} 

## Concatenate Files
```bash
cat file1 file2 > file3 
```
- Combines contents of file1 and file2 into 
file3.
- `tac` command is used to reverse the content of the file. 
- In `cat` we cannot create multiple files at once whereas in touch we can. 

```bash
cat file1 > file2
```
- Copy Content from One File to Another
## 2 Using Touch Command
```bash
touch <filename>
```

- create empty file (Main purpose is Time Stamping)
- stat command to see the stat (access stamp, modify stamp, change/update stamp) 

## 3 using Vi/Vim (editor)
